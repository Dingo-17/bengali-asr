## üöÄ How to Deploy Your Bengali ASR System

I've created a personalized deployment script for you. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Change Your Password First! üîí

**DO THIS NOW before anything else:**

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
2. Change your password
3. Enable 2FA (highly recommended)
```

### Step 2: Run the Deployment Script

Once your password is changed, run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/digantohaque/python/BracV1
./deploy-for-dingo.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Set up Git with your username (Dingo-17)
- ‚úÖ Create repository URL (https://github.com/Dingo-17/bengali-asr)
- ‚úÖ Update frontend configuration
- ‚úÖ Commit and push to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Provide step-by-step instructions

### Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub

When the script asks for authentication, you have **3 safe options**:

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended) ‚≠ê

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Bengali ASR Deployment"
4. Select scopes: ‚úÖ **repo** (all sub-options)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. When git asks for password, **paste the token** (not your password!)

#### Option B: GitHub CLI (Easiest)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Login
gh auth login

# Then re-run the deployment script
./deploy-for-dingo.sh
```

#### Option C: SSH Key

Follow: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
