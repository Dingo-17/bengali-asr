## üìñ Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Fill in details**:
   - Repository name: `bengali-asr` (or any name you like)
   - Description: "Bengali Dialect Speech Recognition System"
   - Make it **Public**
3. **Click**: "Create repository"
4. **Copy the repository URL**: Something like `https://github.com/yourusername/bengali-asr.git`

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (3 minutes)

Open Terminal and run these commands **one by one**:

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd /Users/digantohaque/python/BracV1

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Bengali ASR system"

# Connect to your GitHub repository (use YOUR URL from Step 1)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bengali-asr.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If asked for credentials, use your GitHub username and password
- If using 2FA, create a Personal Access Token (Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens)

### Step 3: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app

2. **Sign In**: Click "Login with GitHub"

3. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your `bengali-asr` repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project

4. **Wait for Deployment** (2-3 minutes):
   - Watch the build logs (optional)
   - Look for "Build successful" and "Deploy successful"

5. **Get Your API URL**:
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Find "Domains" section
   - Copy the URL (looks like: `https://bengali-asr-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)
   - **SAVE THIS URL** - you'll need it next!

6. **Test Your Backend**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   
   Should return something like:
   ```json
   {"status":"ok","model_loaded":true,...}
   ```

### Step 4: Update Frontend with Backend URL (2 minutes)

1. **Open the file** `docs/script.js` in any text editor

2. **Find line 2**, which looks like:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
   ```

3. **Replace it with your Railway URL**:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app';
   ```
   
   **Important:** Use YOUR actual Railway URL from Step 3!

4. **Save the file**

### Step 5: Push Updated Code (1 minute)

```bash
# Add the changed file
git add docs/script.js

# Commit the change
git commit -m "Update API URL for production"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages (3 minutes)

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub

2. **Click "Settings"** tab (top right)

3. **Click "Pages"** in the left sidebar

4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Branch: Select **main**
   - Folder: Select **/docs**
   - Click **Save**

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build your site

6. **Find your URL**:
   - GitHub will show: "Your site is published at..."
   - Copy this URL: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/bengali-asr/`

### Step 7: Test Your Live Website! üéâ

1. **Open your GitHub Pages URL** in a browser

2. **Navigate to "Try Demo"** section (scroll down or click nav link)

3. **Upload an audio file**:
   - Click "Choose Audio File" or drag & drop
   - Supported formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A
   - Maximum size: 10MB

4. **Click "Transcribe"**

5. **See the magic!** 
   - Your audio is sent to the Railway backend
   - The AI model transcribes it
   - The Bengali text appears on screen

**Success!** üéâ Your Bengali ASR system is now live!
